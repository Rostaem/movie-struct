# movie-struct

This program creates and returns a Movie object (string title/ int release_date/ bool popularity/ string director), then displays it using the overloaded stream insertion operator, while also ensuring user input validation (both numerical and string). The Movie object will use a nested struct for Date release_date;
Always passing by pointer, also using smart pointers, using enum for menu options for the first time, separated all function into their respective directories, utils (input validation and menu option)and src (movie.h/cpp)
experimenting with logs
